########## Calculating a Quadratic Sequence
#
# Calculating numbers of the form an^2+bn+c within a range of n
#
# Outputs:
# All of the sequence numbers within a user specified range [n1, n2]
# The sum of all numbers in range
# The product of the first and last number in range
# Whether the calculated product is a multiple of user specified number
#
# Inputs:
# begin_range: First n in the sequence range
# end_range: Last n in the sequence range
# a: Value for a in equation
# b: Value for b in equation
# c: Value for c in equation
# check_for_multiple: Check if calculated product is a multiple of this
